SBS On Demand add-on for Kodi/XBMC
==================================

This add-on allows you to watch TV programs and movies from the SBS On Demand
streaming service.

The content is only available with Australia, or you can apparently use sites
like Unblock-US, UnoTelly or Getflix. or your own VPN solution which
terminates in with an AU IP address.


Installation
------------
First step is the grab the [repo ZIP file] [download].

Simply download the ZIP file to your XBMC/Kodi device and install through the menu via:

System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file.

The Kodi wiki has a good [walk-through guide to installing ZIP files] [installzip] if you get stuck.

Once the repository ZIP file is installed, you can install the individual add-ons through the XBMC/Kodi Add-on manager:

System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Catch-Up TV AU -> Select the add-on category -> Select the add-on -> Install

The Kodi wiki also has a nice guide on [installing Add-ons via the Add-on manager] [addonmanager].

Issues
------
