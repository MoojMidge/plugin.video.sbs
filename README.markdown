SBS On Demand add-on for Kodi/XBMC
==================================

This add-on allows you to watch TV programs and movies from the SBS On Demand
streaming service.

The content is only available with Australia, or you can apparently use sites
like Unblock-US, UnoTelly or Getflix. or your own VPN solution which
terminates in with an AU IP address.

Installation
------------
The latest stable release of this add-on is available as part of the
[XBMC CatchUp TV AU repository] [repository].

If you prefer, you can grab the stable release ZIP file by itself from the
[Github project site download] [download].

For the latest development version, you can grab the [GitHub generated ZIP file] [githubzip].

Simply download the ZIP file to your XBMC device and install through the menu via
System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file, but ensure you've
uninstalled any previous version first.
